# MathKit

MathKit is a Swift library for iOS and macOS that implements common 2D and 3D vector and matrix functions, useful for games or vector-based graphics.

MathKit takes advantage of Swift language features such as function and operator overloading and struct methods to provide a more elegant interface than most C, C++ or Cocoa-based graphics APIs.

- - [x] Matrix3x3
- - [x] Matrix4x4
- - [x] Quaternion
- - [x] Scalar
